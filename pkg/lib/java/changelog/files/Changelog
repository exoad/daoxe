== Changelog for "daoxe" ==
** Author: Jack Meng
** Version: v0.0.2 (Beta)
** Description: Generic Update
** Changes:
    [+] NASA APOD now efficiently caches previous
        results
    [+] Profanity now automatically gets checked
        and if the user has constantly violated
        the rule, they will be muted.
    [+] SimplePoll command allows for a trusted
        advisory member to automatically create a
        poll.
            - This command however requires a
              tedious JSON format to work
    [+] Added a logging function for the bot
        to log actions done by itself or others
        on the server. Details of what is logged
        are always kept confidential
    [-] Removed a NodeJS internal array buffer
        issue that correlated to it crashing the
        NodeJS process and then trying to restart.
    [-] The default NodeJS GC has now been pressured
        to run more often.
    [+] Profanity checker now includes a wider
        variation of checks done for just one slur
        or word.
